## Welcome to Hannah's page

Here, I will be sharing a few of my favorite reads. These are absolutely amazing and I really recommend these. It's not for everyone but to those who might be intrigued with these then, have fun :) This will mostly be a mixture of [manhuas, manhwas, and mangas](https://www.cbr.com/the-differences-between-manga-manhwa-manhua-explained/#:~:text=The%20History%20of%20Manga%2C%20Manhwa%20%26%20Manhua&text=Now%2C%20international%20readers%20use%20these,and%20manhua%20are%20Chinese%20comics.)

### Mo Dao Zu Shi
The image above is a beautiful illustration I found on twitter which was inspired by, my all time favorite, Mo Dao Zu Shi. Mo dao zu shi is a novel with many adaptations such as a donghua (Chinese animation) under the name of The Founder of Diabolism, a manhua (Chinese webtoon), and a live action under the name of [The Untamed](https://www.netflix.com/ph/title/81200228#:~:text=2019%20%7C%20TV-14%20%7C%201,Watch%20all%20you%20want.)
