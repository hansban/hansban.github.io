### Here, I will be sharing a few of my favorite reads. These are absolutely amazing and I really recommend these. It's not for everyone but to those who might be intrigued with these then, have fun :) This will mostly be a mixture of [manhuas, manhwas, and mangas](https://www.cbr.com/the-differences-between-manga-manhwa-manhua-explained/#:~:text=The%20History%20of%20Manga%2C%20Manhwa%20%26%20Manhua&text=Now%2C%20international%20readers%20use%20these,and%20manhua%20are%20Chinese%20comics.)

### Mo Dao Zu Shi
The image below is a beautiful illustration I found on twitter which was inspired by, my all time favorite, Mo Dao Zu Shi featuring our loveable main leads. Mo dao zu shi is a novel with many adaptations such as a donghua (Chinese animation) under the name of The Founder of Diabolism, a manhua (Chinese webtoon), and a live action under the name of [The Untamed](https://www.netflix.com/ph/title/81200228#:~:text=2019%20%7C%20TV-14%20%7C%201,Watch%20all%20you%20want.).

Honestly, I cannot stress how much I love this novel. It is so beautiful and the emotions are so strong and the story is confusing at first but it is so worth it to understand. Understanding the different symbolisms of things makes it even better too!! The other books of this author are also so amazing!!

This is so cool, all I can say. Our main lead is so adorable and good-hearted, there are many cool characters with equally as cool abilities, a great mentor-student relationship, and most importantly there are cute cats.
