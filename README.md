### Here, I will be sharing a few of my favorite reads. These are absolutely amazing and I really recommend these. It's not for everyone but to those who might be intrigued with these then, have fun :) This will mostly be a mixture of [manhuas, manhwas, and mangas](https://www.cbr.com/the-differences-between-manga-manhwa-manhua-explained/#:~:text=The%20History%20of%20Manga%2C%20Manhwa%20%26%20Manhua&text=Now%2C%20international%20readers%20use%20these,and%20manhua%20are%20Chinese%20comics.)

### Mo Dao Zu Shi
The image below is a beautiful illustration I found on twitter which was inspired by, my all time favorite, Mo Dao Zu Shi featuring our loveable main leads. Mo dao zu shi is a novel with many adaptations such as a donghua (Chinese animation) under the name of The Founder of Diabolism, a manhua (Chinese webtoon), and a live action under the name of [The Untamed](https://www.netflix.com/ph/title/81200228#:~:text=2019%20%7C%20TV-14%20%7C%201,Watch%20all%20you%20want.).

Honestly, I cannot stress how much I love this novel. It is so beautiful and the emotions are so strong and the story is confusing at first but it is so worth it once you understanad everything. Understanding the different symbolisms of things makes it even better too!! The other books of this author are also so amazing!!

### Eleceed 
This is so cool, hands down all I can say. Our main lead is so adorable and good-hearted, there are many cool characters with equally as cool abilities, a great mentor-student relationship, and most importantly there are cute cats.

### Viral Hit
This is one of my prtty recent reads. It's amazing so far, really had me on my toes. The are is great the characters and plot is great but sometimes the characters are so cringey. For the first part of the webtoon, I had to stop multiple times in-between reads because of _so much_ second-hand embarrassment. It was so bad...well for me atleast. It is so amazing though, really teaches a bunch of fighting styles and I think they consult a few professional fighters. Honesty, this webtoon kind of makes me wanna learn boxing and judo but we'll see if I actually go through with it aha

### Jujutsu Kaisen
Do I really need to explain? Masterpiece. Magnificent. Ma....gnolia? Mwah. Just absolutely gorgeous. It is so adorable (in the anime) and yet so angsty (recent manga chapters). The artstyle is amazing, the plot is so good, the uniqueness in the character's abilities, and the villains that you hate so much but that's how you know it's good. Truly a work of art plus the author is hilarious too. And for you simps out there, there are hot characters. **very hot**. Want to know more about those hot characters?
